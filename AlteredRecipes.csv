1740,Pumpkin Spice Cake in Jars,Tonkcats,00:35,1999-10-08T05:50:00Z,"Recipes for Cakes Baked In Jars      Ever baked cakes in canning jars? It's neat! ANY quick bread-type cake can be  baked in canning jars. Lighter cakes tend to fall once the jar seals. I usually  bake one jar first -- you have to know how high the batter rises. I usually fill  ONE jar 1/2 full then bake it to see how high it rises, then go from there. You  don't want the cake to come out of the top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2  inch from the lip of the jar. Write it down on your recipe (how far you filled  the jars)! Once you've established how high the cake rises, you can go from  there. The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't know how many  jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end up using around 8.    Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need and go from there. Make sure  your LIDS are new, the rings don't ha  ve to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are  as moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORE SO.

If you aren't in the tristate area, and can't get AMOROSOS rolls (the only thing that is REALLY good on a cheesesteak) then you  have to find a substitute.  Squishy sub rolls will NOT do.  They do not hold together under pressure.  Refrain from buying those \""hero\"" rolls too.  A good hoagie roll is almost rubbery in texture, but quite soft.  The best substitute I have found is a loaf of French bread. Not as good as the real thing, but hey, beggars can't be choosers."",

Many of our recipes are derived from the local community and are featured in this annual derby event. Some history of the Hard Crab Derby, held every Labor Day, follows:  &quot;The first derby was held fifty-two years ago in 1947. This first derby was a simple, uncomplicated affair by today's standards. It consisted of a number of crabs being unceremoniously dumped in the center of a circle which was painted on the street in front of the Post Office.  From these humble beginnings the National Hard Crab Derby has grown into one of Crisfield's most successful festivals. The derby has changed locations many times and is now held on the grounds of the Somers Cove Marina. The race format has also been altered. Instead of the crabs being dumped in the center of a circle, they each have their own &quot;starting gate&quot;. Once this gate is opened the crabs scurry down a platform to the finish line. In addition to the regular crab derby there is now a governor's cup race in which the governors of the states which constitute our union enter a crab contestant. Entries from Hawaii (1967) and Alaska (1968) have even won this race. The first cooking contest was held in 1965. This popular event was won in that year by Nina Coons of Marion Station. Nina entered a delicious crab casserole as her award winning recipe. Because of its superior cooking facilities, the contest has been held in Crisfield High School. Winning chefs have been mainly from Maryland with a few from Delaware and Pennsylvania.&quot;",Crab,"c(""6"", ""1"", ""1"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""1"", ""1 1/2"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""4"")","c(""baking potatoes"", ""sour cream"", ""green pepper"", ""pepper"", ""cheese"", ""milk"", ""mayonnaise"", ""salt"")",5.0,2.0,4.0,"c(""Preheat oven to 400 degrees."", ""Bake potatoes 45 minutes or until done.

I never actually looked at the cookbook until she passed it on to me 3 years ago. I started making this for family get-to-gethers and it is now as popular as &quot;Yuckky Beans&quot; (French's green bean casserole). The original recipe called for 4 (4 oz.) cans of sliced mushrooms with liquid, but fresh mushrooms were on sale so I used them instead. I am trying to eat healthier, so I decreased the amount of margarine from 1/4 cup to 2 T. It called for saltine-type crackers, but I only had ritz-type crackers, so I used them instead. I decreased the amount of light cream from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup light cream and 1/4 cup of 1% milk. It called for baking it covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 30 minutes, but I was in a hurry (as usual) and forgot to cover the dish. When I realized what I had done, I decided to leave it uncovered for the first 30 minutes and covered it for the last 30 minutes.",Vegetable,"c(""1"", ""2"", ""1/2"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""2"", ""4"", ""1/4"", ""1/4"", ""1"")","c(""onion"", ""margarine"", ""egg substitute"", ""1% low-fat milk"", ""fresh mushrooms"", ""cheese spread"", ""salt"", ""ground black pepper"")",5.0,1.0,6.0,"c(""Preheat oven to 350 degrees."", ""Spray a 1.5 quart casserole with cooking spray and set aside."", ""Saute onions and mushrooms in butter."", ""There will be a lot of liquid in the pan from the mushrooms, which is okay."", ""Set aside."", ""Combine all the remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl."", ""Add the cooked onions, mushrooms and liquid to the bowl and mix well."", ""Pour mixture into prepared casserole dish."", ""Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes."", ""Cover and bake an additional 30 minutes."")"
